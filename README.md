=======================

The UK Rivers Guidebook site development repository (phpBB & Joomla templates and extensions).

The source found here is not usable on its own, you would need to configure a LAMP stack and then install Joomla, phpBB and bridge them with the JFusion (Joomla extension). This setup is not a trivial piece of configuration.
